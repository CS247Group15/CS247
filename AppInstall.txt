There is an apk file included, which will install the app
directly onto a phone by running it.

If an alternative is required, you can build yourself a 
version using Eclipse and the project contained in the App
folder.

When the app has been installed onto a phone, a dialog 
will display into which the IP address that the server is
running on should be entered. (If a manual build is being 
used then the serverIp variable in the Constants file can
be set to the required IP address. An example is given as
a comment beside this variable, which shows the required
format for the address.)
